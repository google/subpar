"""Runtime support code for executables created by Subpar.

1. Third-party modules require some PYTHONPATH manipulation.

2. Python can natively import python modules from a zip archive, but
   C extension modules require some help.

3. Resources stored in a .par file may need to be exposed as OS-level
   files instead of Python File objects.

We try a succession of different strategies until we find one that
works.

TODO: Strategy: FUSE filesystem
TODO: Strategy: dlopen_with_offset
TODO: Strategy: extract all files to a temp dir
TODO: Strategy: Do nothing if archive doesn't have any C extension modules
